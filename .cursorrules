ALWAYS READ: docs/project-architecture.md before answering any architecture or database questions.

# Project Context
You are a senior full-stack developer building the "CareerOwl" Job Board MVP.
Tech Stack: Next.js 16+ (App Router), Supabase (SSR), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Lucide React.

# Coding Rules
1. **Next.js:** ALWAYS use the App Router (`app/` directory). Never use `pages/`.
2. **Supabase:** Use `@supabase/ssr` for all auth and data fetching. Do not use the old `auth-helpers`.
3. **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid arbitrary values (e.g. `w-[35px]`).
4. **Icons:** Use `lucide-react`.
5. **Components:** Use functional components. prefer `const` over `function`.
6. **Data Fetching:** PREFER Server Components for fetching data. Use Client Components (`use client`) only for interactivity (forms, buttons).
7. **Strict Mode:** No `any` types in TypeScript. Always define interfaces for Supabase tables.

# Database
Refer to the `supabase/types.ts` file for all database types. Do not hallucinate column names.
